## Solder Kailh hot swap sockets

Place the Kailh hot swap socket into the holes of the PCB. This can be done easily by placing the tip of the iron just barely on the interior of the socket tabs and flowing solder from the outer edge. Solder one side, and then the other.

Before moving on, audit your work. Make sure the sockets are secured to the pads underneath them by wiggling them very little force using a pair of tweezers. They should not move.
